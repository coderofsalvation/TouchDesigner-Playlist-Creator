# TouchDesigner-Playlist-Creator
TouchDesigner 088 component for building simple playlists from a database of items

##Usage
Drag and drop the tox file into your project to add the Playlist Creator. The first output is a DAT Table that shows the current event in the playlist and the next event. The second output shows the time_fraction of the current event and the segment_pulse gets triggered on event change. Useful for preloading the next show element, then starting it on the segment_pulse. Once it is added to the project, use the UI elements marked below to create your playlists.
